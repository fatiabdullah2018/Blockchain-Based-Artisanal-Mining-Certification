# Blockchain-Based Artisanal Mining Certification

A transparent and immutable certification system for artisanal mining operations built using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based solution to validate small-scale mining operations, track mineral production, ensure fair trade practices, and monitor environmental compliance. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a trustless system that benefits all stakeholders in the artisanal mining supply chain.

## Features

### Miner Registration
- Register small-scale mining operations with verifiable credentials
- Track miner status and licensing information
- Provide transparent miner identification

### Production Tracking
- Record mineral extraction with immutable timestamps
- Track mineral types and quantities
- Record sales information and maintain production history

### Fair Trade Verification
- Ensure miners receive fair compensation for their work
- Implement minimum price standards based on market conditions
- Certify batches as fair trade compliant

### Environmental Compliance
- Monitor adherence to ecological standards
- Track water quality, land restoration, and chemical usage
- Maintain compliance history for regulatory purposes

## Smart Contracts

The system consists of four main Clarity contracts:

1. **miner-registration.clar**: Handles the registration and validation of miners
2. **production-tracking.clar**: Records minerals extracted and sold
3. **fair-trade-verification.clar**: Ensures proper compensation to miners
4. **environmental-compliance.clar**: Monitors adherence to ecological standards
